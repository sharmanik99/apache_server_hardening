configured to utilize an approved DoD certificate validation process.

The web administrator should be questioned to determine if a validation process
is being utilized on the web server.

To validate this, the reviewer can ask the web administrator to describe the
validation process being used. They should be able to identify either the use
of certificate revocation lists (CRLs) or Online Certificate Status Protocol
(OCSP).

If the production web server is accessible, the SA or the web administrator
should be able to demonstrate the validation of good certificates and the
rejection of bad certificates.

If CRLs are being used, the SA should be able to identify how often the CRL is
updated and the location from which the CRL is downloaded.

If the web administrator cannot identify the type of validation process being
used, this is a finding."
