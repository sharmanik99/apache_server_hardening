administrators, web managers, developers, auditors, and web authors require
accounts on the machine hosting the web server. This is in addition to the
anonymous web user account. The resources to which these accounts have access
must also be closely monitored and controlled. Only the SA needs access to all
the systemâ€™s capabilities, while the web administrator and associated staff
require access and control of the web content and web server configuration
files. The anonymous web user account must not have access to system resources
as that account could then control the server."
