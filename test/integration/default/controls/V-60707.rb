  title "The web server must remove all export ciphers from the cipher suite."
  desc  "During the initial setup of a Transport Layer Security (TLS)
connection to the web server, the client sends a list of supported cipher
suites in order of preference.  The web server will reply with the cipher suite
it will use for communication from the client list.  If an attacker can
intercept the submission of cipher suites to the web server and place, as the
preferred cipher suite, a weak export suite, the encryption used for the
session becomes easy for the attacker to break, often within minutes to hours."
